That changed everything, from the person deep into coding (still cause I love it) to the person who represents the technical vision of a team and tries to move the group to a better place, technically speaking.</p>
<p>I find myself into future and process thinking more often than I was used to, long discussions with product and design teams, back and forth on ideas, POCs, and the most terrible thing every engineer hates, fighting and negotiating time to work on technical debt and improvements.</p>
<p>It has been interesting! I've learned a ton, and although it has not been that long in this position, I've been exposed to quite some tricky situations already and have been thinking a lot about long-term continuity. I think I can come up with a math formula to prove that long-term continuity can help with software development processes. Isn't this a master's thesis or something? Perhaps I should return to academic life.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle--separator">The success cases and the hidden continuity processes</h2>
<p>You might wonder, "Why is Diel talking about this now?" The most tricky situations I have been in are related to negotiating time, and if there is something I am obligated to agree with YouTube business coaches that time is finite, the most wanted and expensive resource.</p>
<p>So why do some areas have success and others don't? I can't simply accept it is only because they have the time to focus. Let's be honest; many mistakes are made along the way, even when focusing full-time on something, which can be translated to "lost time," and we lost a lot of time. Time is essential, but not the only success factor to take in.</p>
<p>You know where my hunting is, hence the article title. Continuity applied on top of time is a success factor. Take a quick look around you:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product only delivers new features because of a process of continuing to deliver new features</li>
<li>Same for bugs, I hope. The product keeps up with bugs because of a process of continuing to solve bugs</li>
<li>You keep everyone in the company aligned because of a process of continuing to keep everyone aligned.</li>
<li>Your software uses the most updated dependencies because of the process of continuing to update them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it yourself:</p>
<p>{The desired action is successful}, because of a process of continuing doing {desired action}</p>
<h2>The boring continuity graph and its surprising side effects</h2>
<p>Desmond Tutu wisely said, "There is only one way to eat an elephant: a bite at a time." He meant that everything that seems daunting, overwhelming, or even impossible can be accomplished gradually by taking on a little at a time.</p>
<p>A little at a time... continuity.</p>
<p>We will always have big projects to work on, which is excellent. I would hate not to have any impactful or complex problems to work on, which usually translates to lots of work on many different fronts. How can we progress in multiple areas while keeping a good pace on delivering new features, UX/DX improvements, maintenance, fixing bugs, and more?</p>
<p>I'm not advocating having a team that focuses on all of this stuff at the same time, but to be critical and think about what can be parallelized, taking into account the team's capacity so that we can have continuous health progress on areas that will have a positive impact but would never be prioritized.</p>
<p>Your company won't go bank corrupt if the team takes three weeks more to deliver that big feature and yet fixes some bugs and improves DX along the way. But you can only start with people who believe you give them space to succeed and support a solid/healthy process.</p>
<h3>Applying the continuity formula</h3>
<math display="inline">
  <mfrac>
    <msup>
      <mi>Work that needs to get done</mi>
    </msup>
    <mn>Available/wanted Time</mn>
  </mfrac>
</math>
<p>Let's suppose we have a migration work to get done, we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>breakdown and have a clear understanding of the work needed.</li>
<li>Apply and break down chunks of this work on top of available or wanted time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of actions gives us a very boring constant line:</p>
<img src="/images/continuity-applied-to-software-development-processes/graph-1.png" alt="linear graph">
<p>No one sees the side effect of that constant visual representation; we eat the elephant one bit at a time. The side effect is that you will start with lots of work to get done but also linearly decrease this number and get closer to the finish. Isn't this how everything works in software?</p>
<img src="/images/continuity-applied-to-software-development-processes/graph-2.png" alt="linear graph">
<h2>The unmeasurable side effects</h2>
<p>As with everything with humans involved, there will be some side effects that I like to call the unmeasurable ones; they are unmeasurable because we are talking about human feelings, motivations, and beliefs.</p>
<p>Think about this: if your team has been mentioning and asking to work on a long migration that has become a significant problem for the team's velocity and quality for years, this will directly affect the team's happiness and motivation. Not addressing big concerns/projects like that can drastically decrease the team's trust in the company's capacity to support a solid and healthy process.</p>
<p>Side effects also extend beyond productivity metrics. It can increase innovation and creative problem-solving by applying continuity and giving back time to teams since they are not spending all the time and energy trying to figure out how to eat the elephant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we all have one goal: to ship with quality and faster.</p></article><!-- Article Footer --><footer class="mt-16 pt-10 border-t border-ivory-300 dark:border-ink-700"><!-- Author card --><div class="flex items-center gap-5 mb-10"><div class="relative"><div class="absolute -inset-0.5 bg-gradient-to-br from-accent-400 to-accent-600 dark:from-accent-500 dark:to-accent-700 rounded-full opacity-50 blur-sm"></div><img src="/images/diel.jpeg" alt="Diel Duarte" class="relative w-14 h-14 rounded-full object-cover ring-2 ring-ivory-100 dark:ring-ink-900"></div><div><p class="font-display font-semibold text-ink-800 dark:text-ivory-100">Diel Duarte</p><p class="text-sm text-ink-400 dark:text-ivory-400">Principal Engineer at Appcues</p></div></div><!-- Back to home --><a href="/" class="inline-flex items-center gap-3 px-5 py-2.5 border border-ink-200 dark:border-ink-700 text-ink-600 dark:text-ivory-300 hover:bg-ink-800 hover:text-ivory-100 dark:hover:bg-ivory-100 dark:hover:text-ink-800 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200 text-sm font-medium"><svg class="w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.5" d="M7 16l-4-4m0 0l4-4m-4 4h18"></path></svg>Back to all articles</a></footer></div></body></html>
