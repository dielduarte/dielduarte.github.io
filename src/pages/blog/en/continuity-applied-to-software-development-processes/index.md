It wasn't a long time ago that I became a tech lead for the first time in my career, and right after was considered a Staff engineer as well. That changed everything, from the person who was deep into coding (still cause I love it) to the person who represents the technical vision of a team and tries to move the group to a better place technically speaking. Scary isn't it? 

I find myself into future and process thinking more often than I was used to, long discussions with product and design teams, back and forth on ideas, POCs, and the most terrible thing every engineer hates, fighting and negotiating time to work on technical debt and improvements.

It has been...interesting! I've learned a ton, and whereas it has not been that long in this position for me, I've been exposed to quite some tricky situations already and I have been thinking a lot about long-term continuity. I think I can come up with a math formula to prove that long-term continuity can help with software development processes, isn't this a master thesis or something? maybe I should go back to the academy life - don't tell them I'm a dropout! ü§´

<h2 class="subtitle--separator">The success cases and the hidden continuity processes</h2>

As you might be wondering "Why is Diel talking about this now", The most tricky situations I have been in are related to negotiating time, and if there is something I am obligated to agree with YouTube business coaches that time is finite, the most wanted and expensive resource.

So why do some areas have success and others don't? I can't simply accept it is only because they have the time to focus. Let's be honest, lots of mistakes are made along the way even when full-time focusing on something, which can be translated to "lost time", and we lost a lot of time. Time is important I agree, but not the only success factor to take in.

You know where my hunting is, hence the article title, continuity applied on top of time can be indeed a success factor. Take a quick look around you:

- A product only delivers new features, because of a process of continuing to deliver new features
- Same for bugs, I hope. The product keeps up with bugs, because of a process of continuing to solve bugs
- You keep everyone in the company aligned, because of a process of continuing to keep everyone aligned.
- Your software uses the most updated dependencies, because of a process of continuing updating the dependencies.

Try it yourself:

{The desired action is successful}, because of a process of continuing doing {desired action}


<h2>The boring continuity graph and its surprising side effects</h2>

Desmond Tutu once wisely said, ‚ÄúThere is only one way to eat an elephant: a bite at a time.‚Äù What he meant is that everything in life that seems daunting, overwhelming, or even impossible can be accomplished gradually by taking on just a little at a time.

A little at a time... continuity. 

We will always have big projects to work on, which is great, I would hate not to have anything impactful and some complex problems to work on, which usually translate to lots of work on many different fronts. How can we progress in multiple areas and yet keep a good pace on delivering new features, UX/DX improvements, maintenance, fixing bugs, and more?

I'm not advocating having a team that focuses on all of this stuff at the same time, but, to be critical and think about what can be parallelized taking into account the team's capacity so that we can have continuous health progress on areas that will have a positive impact but wouldn't be prioritized. 

Your company won't go bank corrupt if the team takes 3 weeks more to deliver that big feature and yet fixes some bugs and improves DX along the way. But you can't even start without people who believe you give them space to succeed and support a solid/healthy process.


<h3>Applying the continuity formula</h3>

<math display="inline">
  <mfrac>
    <msup>
      <mi>Work that needs to get done</mi>
    </msup>
    <mn>Available/wanted Time</mn>
  </mfrac>
</math>


Let's suppose we have a migration work to get done, we would:

 - breakdown and have a clear understanding of the work needed. 
 - Apply and break down chunks of this work on top of available or wanted time.

This gives us a very boring linear line:

What no one sees is the side effect of that linear visual representation, we are one bit at a time eating the elephant. The side effect here is that you will start with lots of work to get done, but also linearly decrease this number and get closer to finish. Isn't this how everything works in software?

<h2>The unmeasurable side effects</h2>

p.s essa section ta muito ruim ainda... refazer.

As with everything with humans involved, there will be some side effects that I like to call the unmeasurable ones, they are unmeasurable because we are talking about human feelings, motivations, and beliefs.

Think about this, if your team has been mentioning and asking to work on a long migration that has become a large problem on the team's velocity and quality for years, this will directly affect the team's happiness and motivation. 

Not addressing big concerns/projects like that can drastically decrease the trust the team has in the company's capacity to support a solid and healthy process.
